Hoare Logic has a long tradition in formal verification and has been
continuously developed and used to verify a broad class of programs,
including sequential, object-oriented and concurrent programs.
The purpose of this report is to provide a detailed and  accessible
presentation on how to  use the Hoare Logic library that comes with the Isabelle 
distribution in order to conduct and write proofs of correctness of
sequential imperative programs. Special attention is given to the
structured proof language Isar, with which the user can write
down highly readable proofs in a formal language  that is amenable to human understanding, 
both for communication and maintenance.
