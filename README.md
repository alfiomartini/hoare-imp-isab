Hoare Logic has a long tradition in formal verification and has been
continuously developed and used to verify a broad class of programs,
including sequential, object-oriented and concurrent programs.
The purpose of this report is to provide a detailed and  accessible
exposition on how to  use the Hoare Logic library that comes with 
the Isabelle distribution in order to conduct and write proofs of correctness of
sequential imperative programs. Special attention is given to the
proof language \textit{Isar}, with which the user can write
down structured, highly readable proofs in a formal language  that is amenable 
to human understanding, both for communication and maintenance.
