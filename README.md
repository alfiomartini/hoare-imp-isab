The purpose of this report is to provide a detailed and  accessible
exposition of the several ways the user can conduct,
explore and write proofs of correctness of
sequential imperative programs with the Isabelle proof
assistant. Special emphasis is given to the
proof language Isar, with which the user can write
down structured, readable proofs in a formal language  
that is amenable to human understanding, both for communication 
and maintenance.
